<p>The website created under the principle of Playful/Information Design offers a captivating journey through the photos we took during the visit to the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne - Royal Park. The RCH - Royal Park is an iconic institution dedicated to providing specialized medical care to children. Situated in the picturesque Royal Park, the hospital embraces the healing power of nature by incorporating biophilic design principles. 
</p>
<p>The scrolling gallery immerses visitors in a vibrant audio-visual experience that embodies the essence of playfulness. The incorporation of nature-inspired elements in the website design includes the moving leaves and ambient nature sounds. 
As users navigate through the site, the leaves delicately move in response to their scrolling, infusing the webpage with a sense of vitality and life. This dynamic feature contributes to a sense of engagement and captivates the viewer's attention, creating an interactive and immersive experience. The rotating circles, serving as labels for the date and location of the site visit, further enhance the playful aspect of the design. These playful design elements are particularly fitting for a children's hospital, as they bring about excitement and evoke positive emotions, fostering a welcoming and comforting atmosphere.
</p>
<p>To complement the visual journey, a looped ambient background music plays softly in the background, creating a calming and relaxing ambiance. The soothing melodies evoke a sense of tranquility, transporting the viewer to a serene natural setting. This connection to nature is significant, as research has shown that exposure to natural elements has a positive impact on human emotions and well-being. I believe the playful features blended in perfectly with the sense of calm/relaxing nature in the background, making it playful yet soothing.
</p>
<p>Other features include a custom preloader with animation, the page’s title with fading/move-up animation. These create a smooth introduction into the page. The navigation bar on the top-left is also responsive with a hover-transform feature and audio feedback, providing easy access to different sections while being playful.
